# Intergrated-Science-Laboratory-I

* The code involved in this part of the work is somewhat fragmented, with data processing and analysis tasks reflected in the experimental report.

The Integrated Science Laboratory course, taught by Professors Yanyi Huang and Fan Bai, covers a broad and intriguing array of topics. During the course, students engage in various activities, such as measuring the Boltzmann constant, constructing spectrometers, learning LabVIEW, and designing circuits. 

The overall atmosphere of the course is relaxed and enjoyable, significantly broadening students' scientific horizons. This course seems to offer a hands-on approach to learning, integrating practical skills with theoretical knowledge, which not only makes learning more engaging but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the scientific principles at play.
